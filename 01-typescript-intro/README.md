# TypeScript Basic exercise
This section is a review of the basic concepts of TypeScript.


## New Project => Vite + Vanilla-TS
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

2. Run the following command to create a new Vite project:

    ```sh
    yarn create vite
    ```

3. You will be prompted to enter a project name. Type in the name you want to use for your project.

4. After that, you will be asked whether you want to use a JavaScript framework. Since we're creating a vanilla TS project, select "vanilla".

5. Finally, you will be asked whether you want to use TypeScript. Select "vanilla-ts".

6. Wait for the installation process to finish. This may take a few minutes.

## If poject already exist

execute the next command:

```sh
yarn install

# to run the application
yarn dev
```

## Typed

TypeScript is a statically typed programming language. This means that the type of a variable is determined at compile-time rather than at run-time. Types can be specified using the syntax : type.



## Objects

In TypeScript, objects are data structures that can hold values of different types. The syntax for defining objects is similar to that of JavaScript, but with the addition of types.

## Classes

Classes in TypeScript are similar to classes in other object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C#. Classes are defined using the class keyword followed by the name of the class and the body of the class.


## Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a technique used in object-oriented programming to reduce coupling between components. In TypeScript, dependency injection can be implemented using interfaces and classes that implement those interfaces.


## Class and Method Decorators

Decorators are a feature of TypeScript that allow you to modify or add behavior to classes, methods, and properties at runtime. Class and method decorators are specified using the @ symbol followed by the name of the decorator function.
