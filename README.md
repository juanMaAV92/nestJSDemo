</div>

This repository contains the code implemented during the Nest.js and TypeScript course taught by [Fernando Herrera](https://fernando-herrera.com/#/). The course starts from zero knowledge of Nest.js and TypeScript and gradually progresses towards creating more complex applications that can be deployed in production.

During the course, the following topics were covered:

- Nest.js with TypeScript
- Building backend servers with Node.js
- Creating robust and secure Restful APIs
- Connecting to SQL and NoSQL databases
- Implementing websockets
- Data validations and types
- Implementing Nest Guards, interceptors, pipes, controllers, decorators, services, filters, modules, and middlewares

Completing this course, I have gained knowledge and experience in building backend applications with Nest.js and TypeScript that are robust, secure, and scalable.
